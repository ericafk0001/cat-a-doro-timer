- Hover over the cat to watch it respond to your mouse, making it feel like you're interacting with a virtual pet!
- A random cat image is fetched from TheCatAPI and displayed when you click the "Reload Cat" button.
- Notes are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist across sessions.
- Almost everything is customizable, from toggling saving notes, tasks, intervals, etc.
